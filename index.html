        <h1>The Gaint Panda</h1>
        <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as the panda bear (or
            simply the panda), is a bear[6] native to South Central China.[1] It is characterised by its bold black-and-white
            coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring
            musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves
            making up more than 99% of its diet.[7] Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers,
            or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams,
            shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>

        <h1>Etymology</h1>
        <p>
            In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" refers to the lesser-known red panda,[25] thus necessitating
            the inclusion of "giant" and "lesser/red" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013, the Encyclopædia Britannica
            still used "giant panda" or "panda bear" for the bear,[26] and simply "panda" for the red panda,[27] despite the popular
            usage of the word "panda" to refer to giant pandas.
            Since the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear 20 different names, such as
            huāxióng (花熊 "spotted bear") and zhúxióng (竹熊 "bamboo bear").[28] The most popular names in China today are dàxióngmāo
            (大熊貓 literally "giant bear cat"), or simply xióngmāo (熊貓 "bear cat"). The name xióngmāo (熊貓 "bear cat") was originally
            used to describe the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), but since the giant panda was thought to be closely related to the red
            panda, dàxióngmāo (大熊貓) was named relatively.[28] 
            In Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted dàmāoxióng (大貓熊 "giant cat bear"), though many encyclopediae
            and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the "bear cat" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this
            construction, "bear" instead of "cat" is the base noun, making this name more grammatically and logically correct, which
            may have led to the popular choice despite official writings.[28] This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when
            a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.[29][30]</p>
